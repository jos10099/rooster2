# Rooster Grin Front End Dev Test

#Description
For this dev test, I was given a link to github to download assets and a basic structure in which I was to create an entire functional 
front end that in theory could be connected to a backend. During my extended journey creating this, I found the word Junior is 
a phrase that describes me. Using my knowledge and borrowing knowledge from online forums/YouTube videos/ and books, I was able
to complete the task in a manner that I feel satisfactory about.

#Technologies
For this project, I used CSS/HTML/JavaScript/Bootstrap

#Lessons Learned
To say that I learned a lesson would be an understatement. During this project, I admittedly did not fully grasp the situation at the start and 
believe I should have started by making sure I could make this fronted mobile responsive. This thought came quite late, as I wrapped up my desktop view,
I panicked and went to inspect, to find a mess of a mobile responsiveness. I had not planned for such a thing as fully focusing on the front end is newer to me.
Through the power of innovation(lots of research) and reaching out to friends who are quite senior in experience to me, I was able to guide myself to create
an interesting, visually appealing, and responsive mobile design. In the future, I would personally start with mobile responsiveness and work backward from there.
